This is a cyclic backup program for minecraft by Ben Cooper.

With this program you can roll back your minecraft world to
an older version of that world.

This program was designed for python 3.3.2

Important instructions:
-The main program is minebackup.exe
-Do not alter any files in the installation directory
-To rollback your world simply select a backup and copy it into
your minecraft save path and rename it to the name of the world.
-This program can be used on any folder
-Refrain from copying extremely large directories
-Each backup is scheduled in a different in a different thread so the
program will not fully stop until its current backup is completed
(even if the GUI is not showing).  If the folder contains large items 
you will have to wait for this to finish.

Credits:
-Program created By Ben Cooper in python
-GUI designed using tkinter
-Written in Wing IDE
-Compiled using cx_freeze
-Setup created with Inno setup

Thank-you to the creators of these programs without which this would
not have been possible.
